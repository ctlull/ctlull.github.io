			<h1>Collin's Hobbies</h1>
			<p class = "Hobbies">Collin enjoys spending his free time with family and friends. Whether it be 
			at his family farm helping his grandfather with animals or up at their cabin fishing on the lake,
			he enjoys everything outdoors. Hunting, fishing, and taking Jeep rides are some of his favorite activities to do outdoors. 
			For indoor activities, Collin enjoys sports such as football, wrestling, and also golf every once in a while. 
			His favorite sports teams are the Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Brewers and Bucks, and of course, the Wisconsin Badgers.</p>
